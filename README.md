# GIS_Class

This will hold some work from my GIS course through the University of Vermont. I did try to make the remote repository and it says it did it, but I can't see it in my file explorer.

Ideally it'll include my final map layouts as PDFs, the lab instructions as PDFs, and all other files (basically each Lab folder) as a zip file in case anyone wants to open the Projects
